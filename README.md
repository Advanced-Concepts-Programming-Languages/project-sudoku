# Sudoku Project

You can find the instructions of the project in the file `sudoku.ipynb`.

To submit your solution, please modify the file [sudoku.lp](asp/sudoku.lp) with your encoding.

Every time you push a new commit, your solution will be tested automatically.

After a few minutes you will be able to see the result of the test in the **Actions** tab.
You can get more information about the result of the test by clicking successively on:
1. The specific test.
2. "Autograding".
3. "Run education/autograding@v1".

Then scroll down until around line 150.
For each instance, you will see if the test is a:
* "success" (correct answer),
* "failure" (wrong answer),
* "timeout" (no solution found before the time runs out), or
* "error" (clingo error).
